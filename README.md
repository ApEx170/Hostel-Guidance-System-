# Hostel-Guidance-System

The Hostel Guidance System project aims to develop a user-friendly, effective, and trustworthy platform that helps tourists, students, and anyone else looking for hostel lodgings discover, select, and reserve appropriate lodging. The following goals are intended to be addressed by the project:
    
    a.	Simplify Hostel Search: Give consumers a clear, user-friendly interface so they can quickly search, filter, and select hostels that meet their needs and preferences.
    b.	Effective Reservation Procedure: Facilitate users' ability to easily make reservations by offering a simple, safe, and user-friendly reservation procedure.
    c.	User Management and Engagement: Put in place user profile management features that let users keep track of their preferences, look back at past reservations, and interact with the system by leaving reviews and ratings.
    d.	Administrative Control: Give administrators the resources they need to keep an eye on user behavior, update hostel listings, and produce reports for performance evaluation.
    e.	Reliability and Security: Give data security priority to protect user information and system transactions.
